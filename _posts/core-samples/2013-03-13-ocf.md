### Spring Bean conventions - Aaron

* Aaron Reviewed this [Document](https://confluence/display/POS/Expweb+and+Spring+Framework) talking about the new conventions for organizing spring bean files.  
* Keep an eye out for changes coming in this space.
* You will be seeing a lot of bean files being moved around and renamed, and split into the proper contexts
* Platform team will have examples next week with concrete examples to show.
* If you want to aggressively move your beans over, talk to the platform team, and we can help with that.
* The current focus is on data access , specifically iSprocInvocable. we are refactoring the beans, and moving the implementations, and beans into data access.  You will see a lot of changes coming in here recently and coming up.

### Staying ALive Status
* 03-R3 should see apache httpd installed in front of expweb's tomcat instance.  
* Apache will run mod_rewrite, and mod_security and listen for http and https traffic, and passing that traffic to tomcat over ajp
* Emain will continue to send traffic to expweb over ajp.
* Once this is in place, we will be able to do the switching at the nginx layer, sending e3 traffic directly to expweb, bypassing emain.
