# Introduction
This is the first post that I am making with the jekyll hosting engine, and I am checking out to see if it 
is a viable way for me to manage the static documentation that I want to create for things
like my daily writing and such.  

What would I like to make sure happens here?  I might need to make sure that I clean out the JB/setup
